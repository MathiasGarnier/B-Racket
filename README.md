Hello you, I should welcome you to this epic poem, but no. You're an adventurer and you will have to make your own way.
Truce of blah blah...

All along this adventure, you will have to achieve some missions (see Aims). 
> But, of which fucking adventure you speak since earlier ?!
Hmmm... Pretty good question, I must tell you all the story from the begin...

04/06/1996, an unknown event could have been avoided. The flap of a butterfly’s wings in Brazil has set off a tornado in Texas

**Aims**:

- [x] Have Fun
- [x] Write your first Racket program, a Hello World program.
- [ ] Write incredible things in Racket (yup).
- [ ] Implement Schrödinger equation.
- [ ] Become a **Racket Master**.
- [ ] Understand life.
- [ ] BRA-KET.
