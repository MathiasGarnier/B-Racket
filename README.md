Hello you, I should welcome you to this epic poem, but no. You're an adventurer and you will have to make your own way.
Truce of blah blah...

All along this adventure, you will have to achieve some missions (see Aims).

**Aims**:

- [x] Have Fun
- [x] Write your first Racket program, a Hello World program.
- [ ] Write incredible things in Racket (yup).
- [ ] Become a **Racket Master**.
- [ ] Understand life.
