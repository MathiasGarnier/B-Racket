Hello you, I should welcome you to this epic poem, but no. You're an adventurer and you will have to make your own way.
Truce of blah blah...

All along this adventure, you will have to achieve some missions (see Aims). 
> But, of which fucking adventure you speak since earlier ?!
Hmmm... Pretty good question, I must tell you all the story from the begin...

04/06/1996, a strange event could have been avoided. The flap of a butterfly’s wings in Brazil has set off a tornado in Texas. Why did I tell you this ? Please wait a moment...
The Texas' governor emitted a message to all world citizen

**Aims**:

- [x] Have Fun
- [x] Write your first Racket program, a Hello World program.
- [ ] Write incredible things in Racket (yup).
- [ ] Implement Schrödinger equation.
- [ ] Become a **Racket Master**.
- [ ] Beat that's fucking butterfly (must use [CFD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_fluid_dynamics) for simulate wind and tornado AND maybe, why not, simulate a sniper shot between Texas and Brazil (yup)).
- [ ] Understand life.
- [ ] BRA-KET.
